- 👋 Hi, I’m @jennylreid
- 👀 I’m interested in implementing an optimal end-to-end i18n/l10n process (I've spent most of my career fixing existing processes)
- 🌱 I’m learning git atm so I can submit best practice examples for intl softweare libraries
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI use cases for localization, plus i18n and l10n standards
- 📫 jennylreid@gmail.com or message me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyreid/)
